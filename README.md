# weatherwise-shaaista-gazelle
Welcome to WeatherWise, the application is python-based and uses actual meteorological data and visualisations to give users insights into their local or selected weather conditions. With the help of conversational AI,this app was created and has integrated prompting techniques to construct and refine the coding elements. 🤖📈





🚀Explanation on How to Use the App

Open the Notebook
You will see that starter_notebook.ipynb is the first thing to appear. It contains all the essential functionality.

Enter any Location or place
Use the provided input prompts that's given in the notebook to enter any city or location.

Obtain the present Conditions + Forecast
Then the app will retrieves weather data from wttr.in, processes it, and returns:

Actual current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and condition

Five-day forecast with midday summaries

Visualise the Forecast
It also generates avisible Matplotlib line graph showing the 5-day temperature forecast.

Error Handling is integrated
In case the input is invalid or the API fails, helpful messages will be there to guide the user.

🧠 AI Collaboration Overview
AI was used throughout development to:

Get initial code for gthering weather data 

Refactor the code to make it easier to read, structure, and handle error 

Create plotting methods with a much better style

Generate docstrings and provide assisstance for debugging

All AI conversations are logged and included in the ai-conversations/ folder.

📁 The structure of the Submission Folder
Here’s what’s included in this repository:

starter_notebook.ipynb file — Your primary project notebook

ai-conversations/ —This Folder containing all the 5 AI conversation logs saved as .txt
The before/after comparisons saved as .md file

submission/

reflection.md — 300–500 words reflection on your AI-improved development process

checklist-md.md — Submission checklist to confirm that task has been completed

one-page-summary.md (optional) — Key summary of project decisions (if completed)

resources: AI techniques that has been used, some guides or tips

✅ Submission Checklist

📌 Notes
This app was built based on the usage of requests and matplotlib.

All API calls are being done by using wttr.in.

Forecast results are processed only to include the most relevant details for end users.

💬 Support
If you are intereted to know how some specific functions were being written or improved, go check the ai-conversations/ folder and the prompts listed in the notebook markdown cells.

Good luck exploring WeatherWise! 🌤️✨
