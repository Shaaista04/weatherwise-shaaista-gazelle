✍️ Project Reflection
AI Tools that has been used
For this assignment, I mostly used ChatGPT (GPT-4) as my AI development assistant. 
It was very important in helping me design, debug, and refine various components when creating the WeatherWise application. 
From processing JSON data from the wttr.in API to the creation of structured weather output and creating clear visualisations, the AI played a crucial role in every step. 
I also used it to reword prompts, make correction of logic errors, and improve the overall code structure to make easier to reaad. Apart from being a great time-saver, the AI also improved my understanding of Python coding.

------------------------
Prompting Techniques
I used a number of intentional prompting strategies throughout the project. 
Firstly, I begin with some simple prompts (e.g., “Write a function to gather weather data”) and gradually work my way to a much more refined, multi-part prompts that requested better structure, error handling, user input validation, and documentation.
I also make used of before/after examples comparison, where I identify the problems with the initial code then explain how it can be improved. 
After that, I asked the AI to help with visualisation enhancements and debugging errors, providing context-specific details to get accurate responses. 
By documenting these interactions, I built a clear trail of how my thinking and the code improved together.

------------------------
What Worked Well?
I must say I'm very proud of how the get_weather_data() function turns out. 
I started working with a raw API request and ended with a neat, modular function that returns only informations that are necessaary, with full error handling and validation. 
The same applies for the visual of my function—my prompt to make it more neat, easier to read, and polished led to a user-friendly chart with rotated x-axis labels, titles that are very clear, and far better structure. 
These advances were a result of purposeful prompting and iterative feedback that we gather from the AI.

What Would You Do Differently?
IfI got more time, I would have looked into interactive data visualisation libraries like Plotly to increase the dynamic of the charts.
I also wanted to add unit tests to make sure that each function performs as expected with edge circumstances.
Finally, adding user input via a very simple command-line interface or basic GUI would have made the app more easy for end users.

My Final Thoughts
By doing this project, it helped me shift from the usage of AI as an easy way and lazy way to using it as a learning and collaboration tool. 
I realized that the way I phrase my prompts has a direct impact that affects the quality of the AI's response. 
More importantly, it showed me how to stay in control of the development process while still make benefits from the speed and versatibility of AI’s.
It was a really nice learning experience that helped improved both my coding and communication skills.
