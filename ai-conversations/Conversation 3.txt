Me: I want users to ask questions like “Will it rain tomorrow?” and get answers.

AI: You can write a basic natural language matcher. Example:

```python
def answer_weather_question(question, forecast_data):
    question = question.lower()
    if "rain" in question:
        for item in forecast_data['list']:
            if "rain" in item['weather'][0]['main'].lower():
                return "Yes, it might rain."
        return "No rain expected."
    return "Sorry, I didn’t understand the question."
```

Me: What if the user asks about temperature?

AI: Add another condition:

```python
if "temperature" in question:
    return f"Temperature will be around {forecast_data['list'][0]['main']['temp']}°C"
```
